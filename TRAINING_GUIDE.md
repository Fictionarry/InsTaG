Training Models in the InsTaG Framework

1. Installation & Setup

Before training models in InsTaG, ensure your system meets the requirements and that all dependencies are installed properly. InsTaG was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with CUDA 11.3 or 11.7 and PyTorch 1.12.1 / 1.13.1 ￼. An NVIDIA GPU with sufficient VRAM is needed for training (for example, around 12 GB of RAM per 5 minutes of video is required when preloading data during training) ￼. Multiple GPUs can accelerate certain steps (InsTaG’s geometry preprocessing can utilize up to 4 GPUs in parallel) ￼. Here is a step-by-step setup guide:
	1.	Clone the Repository: Download the official InsTaG code from GitHub and update submodules. For example:

git clone https://github.com/Fictionarry/InsTaG.git  
cd InsTaG  
git submodule update --init --recursive

This will pull in any sub-repositories (like custom CUDA ops) that InsTaG relies on.

	2.	Create Conda Environment: Use the provided environment file to set up a Conda environment with all necessary packages. For instance:

conda env create -f environment.yml  
conda activate instag

This installs the correct Python version (3.9) and dependencies listed in environment.yml ￼. If you have CUDA 11.7 or 12.1, InsTaG also provides alternate environment files (e.g. environment_cu117.yml or environment_cu121.yml) to match your CUDA version.

	3.	Install Additional Libraries: A couple of specialized libraries need manual installation:
	•	PyTorch3D: Install the latest compatible PyTorch3D build (the InsTaG README suggests installing via pip from the Git repo) ￼. For example: pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git".
	•	TensorFlow: InsTaG uses a TensorFlow component (for audio feature extraction or alignment). Install TensorFlow GPU 2.10 (compatible with CUDA 11) via pip: pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.10.0 ￼.
If any compilation issues arise (particularly with submodules like the differentiable Gaussian rasterization or the neural grid encoder), refer to their documentation for fixes ￼. (The README links to the respective projects for troubleshooting those specific builds.)
	4.	Download Pre-trained Tools & Models: Run the provided setup script to fetch necessary auxiliary models. For example:

bash scripts/prepare.sh

This will download pre-trained weights for various tools InsTaG uses (e.g., face landmark detectors, audio models) and place them in the appropriate directories ￼. The script ensures you have all the helper data needed to proceed.

	5.	Obtain the 3D Morphable Model (BFM2009): InsTaG requires the Basel Face Model 2009 for 3D face pose and shape estimation. You’ll need to download 01_MorphableModel.mat from the Basel Face Model website (registration may be required) ￼. Once downloaded:
	•	Copy the file to data_utils/face_tracking/3DMM/01_MorphableModel.mat
	•	Run the conversion script to prepare it for use:

cd data_utils/face_tracking  
python convert_BFM.py


This converts the BFM model into a format usable by InsTaG’s face tracking module ￼.

	6.	Setup EasyPortrait for Teeth Masking: InsTaG uses EasyPortrait (a portrait segmentation tool) to generate teeth masks for the talking head. Install the required packages for EasyPortrait and download its pre-trained model:

pip install -U openmim && mim install mmcv-full==1.7.1 prettytable  
wget "https://rndml-team-cv.obs.ru-moscow-1.hc.sbercloud.ru/..." -O data_utils/easyportrait/fpn-fp-512.pth

The above installs MMCV (for EasyPortrait) and retrieves the fpn-fp-512.pth model file ￼. Ensure this file is saved under data_utils/easyportrait/ as shown, so the teeth mask generation code can load it.

	7.	Setup Sapiens for Geometry Priors: InsTaG can leverage Meta’s Sapiens models to generate geometry priors (depth, normal maps, etc.) for the face. This requires a separate Python environment (Python 3.10 with PyTorch 2.2+). The README suggests creating a new Conda env for Sapiens:

conda create -n sapiens_lite python=3.10 -y  
conda activate sapiens_lite  
conda install pytorch==2.2.1 torchvision==0.17.1 torchaudio==2.2.1 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia  
pip install opencv-python tqdm json-tricks

Then download the Sapiens models (which are large; Git LFS is required) by running:

bash scripts/prepare_sapiens.sh

By default, this grabs the 0.3B parameter Sapiens models (to save space), though 2B models are available for potentially better results ￼. After this, the Sapiens-based geometry estimator will be ready.

With these steps completed, the InsTaG environment should be set up. In summary, you have created the instag Conda environment with all necessary libraries, installed special dependencies (PyTorch3D, TensorFlow, MMCV), and downloaded critical data (pretrained weights, BFM model, EasyPortrait model, Sapiens models). You are now ready to prepare data and train models.

2. Model Training & Fine-Tuning

InsTaG’s training process involves two main phases: an identity-free pre-training phase to learn general talking motion patterns, and a person-specific fine-tuning phase to adapt those patterns to a new individual ￼. This approach allows the model to achieve high-quality lip-sync and facial expressions with very limited data by leveraging the knowledge learned from other speakers.

Figure: Overview of the InsTaG framework. Top: Identity-Free Pre-training learns a universal motion field from a long-video corpus of various speakers, capturing common speech motion dynamics (mouth movements, facial expressions, etc.). Bottom: Motion-Aligned Adaptation uses a short video of a new identity to align the universal motion field to that person’s face (with the aid of geometry priors and an “FM hook” that synchronizes inner-mouth movements to the lips), resulting in a personalized 3D talking head model. ￼

Pre-training (Identity-Free Stage)

Training a model from scratch in InsTaG starts with the identity-free pre-training stage. In this stage, you train a base model on a set of videos from multiple people to learn general audio-to-motion mappings (i.e. how speech sounds correspond to facial movements) without focusing on any single identity’s appearance. This learned universal motion field will later be adapted to specific individuals. If you have access to several talking head videos (preferably videos on the order of a few minutes each, featuring clear speech and frontal view of different people), you can perform this pre-training. The steps are:
	1.	Prepare a Pre-training Dataset: Organize a collection of videos of different speakers. For example, create a directory structure like:

data/pretrain/  
  ├── person1/person1.mp4  
  ├── person2/person2.mp4  
  ├── person3/person3.mp4  
  └── ...  

Each subfolder under data/pretrain contains one video (and will later hold its extracted frames and features). In the InsTaG paper, they used 5 videos for pre-training (e.g. clips of public figures speaking) ￼. The more diverse and long these videos, the better the model can learn universal speech motions.

	2.	Pre-process Each Video: For each video in data/pretrain, run the preprocessing scripts to extract frames and audio features, and prepare any necessary auxiliary data (face landmarks, etc.). Specifically, you should:
	•	Extract frames and audio: Use the process.py script to convert each video into frames and a WAV audio file. For example:

python data_utils/process.py data/pretrain/person1/person1.mp4

This will create a directory data/pretrain/person1/frames/ with video frames and data/pretrain/person1/audio.wav with the audio ￼. Ensure videos are 25 FPS and the person’s face is visible in all frames (the script assumes a talking head scenario) ￼. If a video is very long, you can optionally use data_utils/split.py to split it, but for pre-training it’s usually fine to use the whole video.

	•	Extract facial Action Units (AUs): Run OpenFace’s FeatureExtraction on the frames to get a CSV of facial action unit intensities over time. This yields a file with columns representing expressions (smile, brow raise, etc.) per frame. Rename the output (e.g., person1.csv) to au.csv and place it in the video’s folder: data/pretrain/person1/au.csv ￼. These AUs are used to help capture expression details in training or for evaluation.
	•	Generate a teeth mask for each frame: Use the EasyPortrait tool to create a mask of the teeth region (this helps the model handle mouth interior vs. exterior properly). Run:

export PYTHONPATH=./data_utils/easyportrait  
python data_utils/easyportrait/create_teeth_mask.py data/pretrain/person1

This will produce images masking out teeth (and possibly the inner mouth) for each frame and save them in data/pretrain/person1/teeth_mask/ ￼. The model can use these to avoid blurring teeth or mixing them with lips during training.
Note: For pre-training data, you do not need the geometry priors from Sapiens ￼ (that step is mainly for adaptation on very short videos). Pre-training videos are typically longer, so skip the geometry prior generation to save time.

	3.	Run the Pre-training: Once all pretrain videos are processed, launch the training script. InsTaG provides bash scripts in the scripts/ directory for various configurations. A general one is pretrain_con.sh, which trains the combined face+mouth model with a default audio feature (DeepSpeech). For example:

bash scripts/pretrain_con.sh data/pretrain output/pretrain_model 0

This command will train on the dataset data/pretrain, save outputs (checkpoints) under output/pretrain_model/, and use GPU 0 ￼. The training will involve both a face network and a mouth network that learn to reconstruct each training video frame given the audio, accumulating a universal motion field (denoted as $H_U$ in the figure) that is not tied to any single identity’s appearance. Training can take some time depending on the video lengths and GPU. Monitor the console for progress and any issues.
	•	Memory Considerations: Pre-loading all frames of long videos can consume a lot of RAM. As noted in the documentation, each 5-minute video can use ~12GB of system RAM if fully loaded ￼. If you encounter memory constraints, you might implement an on-the-fly loading scheme (modifying the data loader to load frames from disk as needed, rather than all at once). Otherwise, ensure your system has adequate RAM or consider using shorter clips for pre-training.
	•	Audio Feature Options: By default, the scripts might use DeepSpeech features. InsTaG also supports other audio extractors (explained in Speech Synchronization below). If you want to use a different audio representation (for example, Wav2Vec or AVE) during pre-training, you would use a different script or add the flag --audio_extractor to the training command ￼. There are provided scripts like pretrain_ave.sh for using AVE, etc., or you can edit pretrain_con.sh to switch the feature. Using the same audio feature for pre-training and later adaptation is recommended for consistency.

	4.	(Optional) Use Provided Pre-trained Weights: If you do not wish to pre-train from scratch, the authors have made available pre-trained model weights from their experiments ￼. These include a universal motion field trained on five English-speaking videos. Downloading and using these can skip the above step: you would place the checkpoint files under output/<name> (e.g., output/pretrain_model/) and later load them for adaptation. Keep in mind that these weights are for research and mainly English-language motions ￼. If your target use-case involves a very different language or speaking style, or if you need maximum personalization, you should eventually pre-train on data closer to your domain. (The authors also released a trial weight including some Chinese data for non-English use, to experiment with cross-lingual capability ￼.) In summary, using the provided model can get you started quickly, but for the best results on your specific data you’d perform the above pre-training yourself.

After pre-training, you will have a model (or set of model weights) that encode general facial motion given audio. Next, you will fine-tune this model to your specific avatar (target person).

Fine-Tuning (Adaptation Stage)

Fine-tuning in InsTaG is referred to as Motion-Aligned Adaptation. This is where the model learns the details of a new person’s face and talking style from a short video (even as short as 5–10 seconds). The pre-trained motion field from the previous step is used as a starting point, so the model doesn’t need to “re-learn” how talking generally works – it only needs to learn how this new person moves and looks. The result is a person-specific model capable of generating that person’s talking head with synchronized speech. Here’s how to perform adaptation:
	1.	Prepare and Pre-process the Target Video: Take the short video of the person for whom you want to create the talking avatar. Ideally, this video should have the person speaking clearly with visible facial movements (e.g., not obscured or turned away). Similar to pre-training, you will:
	•	Extract frames and audio: place the video in data/<ID>/<ID>.mp4 (where <ID> is an identifier name for the person, e.g., data/alice/alice.mp4). Then run:

python data_utils/process.py data/alice/alice.mp4

This creates data/alice/frames/* and data/alice/audio.wav. Ensure the video is 25 FPS and about the resolution used in training (around 512x512 with the face reasonably centered) ￼ for best results. If the video is longer than ~10-15 seconds, the script will also by default split it: it tries to reserve at least 12 seconds for evaluation by creating a separate test clip ￼. For example, from a 20s video, it might use ~8s for training and 12s for testing. You can also manually call split.py if needed to enforce a certain split.

	•	Compute facial Action Units: as with pre-training, run OpenFace’s FeatureExtraction on the frames to get au.csv for this person ￼. This file (placed in data/alice/au.csv) will be used to evaluate expression accuracy and could be used in training losses if configured.
	•	Generate the teeth mask: run the EasyPortrait script for this person’s frames, e.g.:

python data_utils/easyportrait/create_teeth_mask.py data/alice

This will create data/alice/teeth_mask/ images for the teeth region ￼. Having a good teeth mask helps the renderer keep the teeth separated from lips, which is important for realism when the mouth opens.

	•	(Optional) Generate geometry priors: If your target video is very short (only a few seconds), it’s recommended to use the Sapiens model to compute geometry priors (like a coarse 3D shape of the head for some key frames) to guide the training ￼. To do this, ensure your sapiens_lite environment is active and run:

bash data_utils/sapiens/run.sh data/alice

This will use the Sapiens model to estimate depth/normal maps for the first 500 frames (or fewer, if the video is shorter) of alice using up to 4 GPUs in parallel ￼. It will output data in data/alice/geom/ (for example). These geometry priors help the model understand the 3D structure of the new face with very little data. Note: If your training video is longer (e.g., on the order of minutes), you can skip this step – in fact, if you run the training in --long mode (explained below), InsTaG will not expect geometry priors ￼.

	2.	Fine-Tune the Model on the New Identity: Now run the adaptation training script provided by InsTaG. There are scripts like train_df_few.sh or train_ave_few.sh (the naming may correspond to the audio feature: e.g., df for DeepSpeech features, ave for AVE features, etc.). For example, if using DeepSpeech (the default):

bash scripts/train_df_few.sh data/alice output/alice_model 0

This will take the frames and data in data/alice, load the pre-trained universal model (it will use the checkpoint from the pre-training stage – make sure the script is pointed to the correct checkpoint file in output/pretrain_model/), and fine-tune it, saving results to output/alice_model/ ￼. By default, the script uses about 10 seconds of the video for training (the rest, if any, is kept for testing) ￼. During this process, the model’s parameters (especially those that control the personalized appearance and any person-specific motion nuances) are adjusted to minimize error on the training frames.
What happens under the hood: the training script will automatically split the video into train and test segments (unless you used a separate clip for test). Typically, if your video is, say, 10 seconds long, it might use the first 8 seconds for training and last 2 seconds for testing (ensuring at least 12 seconds for test isn’t always possible if the whole video is 10s; in such cases, it may use most for training and still reserve some for evaluation). If you have more data and want to use it all for training (i.e., no test), you can set the --all_for_train option which merges the clips and forgoes a separate test evaluation ￼. However, having a test segment is useful for evaluating performance, so use --all_for_train only when you specifically need to maximize training data at the cost of not measuring quality on held-out frames.
Some useful customization options for the training script include:
	•	Audio feature selection: If your pre-trained model and data use a different audio feature extractor (e.g., you want to use Wav2Vec features instead of DeepSpeech), add --audio_extractor <type> to the command (or edit the script). Supported types are deepspeech (default), ave, esperanto (the Wav2Vec feature is labeled as Esperanto in code), and hubert ￼. Make sure you have run the corresponding audio preprocessing to produce the required .npy files (for instance, wav2vec.py to produce _eo.npy files for Wav2Vec, or hubert.py for HuBERT features) ￼ ￼. InsTaG’s scripts assume DeepSpeech by default, so specifying the extractor ensures it loads the correct feature file.
	•	Number of training frames: By default, the training will use all frames in the designated training clip (--N_views -1 means no limit) or a certain number if specified. If you want to restrict training to a subset (for example, to simulate even fewer shots), you can set --N_views to some value (it multiplies by 25 to get number of frames, since 25 FPS) ￼. Typically, you will leave this as -1 to use all available training frames.
	•	Short vs Long video mode: If your training video is substantially longer (on the order of minutes, which is beyond the typical “few-shot”), consider using the --long flag ￼. In long mode, the system knows you have abundant data and will disable certain regularizations intended for scarce data. Notably, if --long is set with --N_views -1, InsTaG skips using geometry priors (since with lots of real frames, the model can learn geometry directly) ￼. So, you can save time by not generating geometry priors for long videos. Essentially, --long tells the model “we have enough data, focus on fitting it directly.”
	•	Learning rates or iterations: In some cases, you might want to adjust how many epochs or iterations the fine-tuning runs, or the learning rate. The provided scripts have defaults that worked in the paper (they aim to converge with a short video without overfitting). If you find the avatar isn’t capturing details, you could increase training iterations; if it’s starting to jitter or copy exact frames (overfit), you might reduce them or use early stopping. These adjustments require editing the training script or the code configurations.

	3.	Evaluate the Model: Once fine-tuning completes, the script will typically output some evaluation metrics and a rendered video of the model on the test clip (the portion of the video held out). For example, it might save the reconstructed test video frames to a folder like output/alice_model/test/ours_None/renders/ ￼. Check that folder for the output video frames (or a combined video file if provided). You should also see printed metrics – InsTaG’s paper reports metrics like lip-sync error, expression error, and image quality comparisons. These are often computed by comparing the generated video with the ground truth test video (using features like DeepSpeech for lip-sync score, or computing differences in action units, etc.). For instance, they mentioned using DeepSpeech features to quantify lip-sync and found their method performs best in lip synchronization ￼ ￼. If the metrics look good (low lip-sync error, good image quality) and the rendered video looks realistic, then the model has successfully adapted. If not, consider the fine-tuning tips below.
	4.	Inference (Talking with the Avatar): With the trained avatar model, you can drive it with new audio. InsTaG provides a synthesize_fuse.py script to generate talking head videos from given audio inputs. For example:

python synthesize_fuse.py -S data/alice -M output/alice_model --audio <path_to_feature>.npy --audio_extractor <type>

This will take the trained model in output/alice_model and apply a new audio. You need to provide a preprocessed audio feature file (--audio argument) that matches the extractor type. If you use --audio_extractor deepspeech and don’t provide --audio, it might default to using the original audio (since DeepSpeech features for the test were likely computed). For AVE, you specifically must provide a WAV file path via a different flag (as AVE internally loads the wav) ￼. The result frames will be saved under output/alice_model/inference/ with the chosen audio. This is how you can make the avatar “say” new things. Integrating this into a real-time system would involve computing audio features on the fly and feeding them to the model (which runs in real-time or faster according to the paper ￼).

Fine-Tuning Tips (Facial Expressions, Lip-Sync, Responsiveness): Fine-tuning is as much an art as a science, especially when you want the highest fidelity in expressions and synchronization. Here are some best practices and strategies:
	•	Use High-Quality Audio Features: The choice of audio representation greatly influences lip-sync accuracy. InsTaG supports multiple options – if you find the lip synchronization is not tight with the default, try switching to a more robust audio feature. For example, Wav2Vec 2.0 features often improve sync and realism of mouth movements compared to the older DeepSpeech features ￼. The AVE (Audio-Visual Expert) feature from SyncTalk was noted to achieve the best lip-sync in InsTaG’s few-shot tests ￼. It encodes audio in a way that aligns closely with mouth motion, which can make the avatar’s lip movements extremely accurate to the speech (at the cost of sometimes being less stable if the model isn’t perfectly tuned). If using AVE, follow InsTaG’s guidance to ensure stability (monitor for any jitter or misalignment, and if present, you might need to slightly increase training data or regularization). HuBERT features are another option, especially if you deal with languages beyond English – they carry rich phonetic information and can generalize to non-English speech ￼. However, HuBERT’s high-dimensional embeddings might require a bit more training data (e.g., >10 seconds) to not overfit ￼. In summary, pick the audio feature that best suits your scenario and consider experimenting: run short test inferences with each to see which yields the most natural lip movements for your avatar.
	•	Incorporate Facial Action Unit Feedback: Since you extracted facial Action Units (AUs) from the training video, you can use them to fine-tune expressions. One approach is to include an auxiliary loss during training that penalizes differences in AUs between the generated face and the ground truth frames. For example, if the person smiles in frame 50 (high AU12 “lip corner puller”), ensure the model output for frame 50 also has a high AU12. InsTaG’s code includes metrics for AU error (auerror.py computes how far off the expressions are). Using such a metric as a training signal can help the model not just match pixels but also the expression behind those pixels. If implementing this is complex, at least use the AUs as an evaluation guide: after training, compare the AU curves of the generated video vs. real. If you see discrepancies (e.g., the real video has eyebrow raises that the model missed), you might need to train a bit longer or adjust the loss balance to emphasize those features.
	•	Leverage the Two-Branch Architecture: InsTaG’s model separates the outer face (including lips) from the inner mouth (teeth, tongue) during rendering. A challenge with such a design is ensuring that the two parts move in harmony – if not properly coordinated, the avatar might have the lips say one thing and the inner mouth lag or lead, causing an uncanny effect. The authors address this by introducing a feature-matching hook (FM-hook) that uses the lip motion as a guide for the inner mouth movement ￼. In practice, this means the model predicts a scaling factor for inner-mouth deformation based on how much the lips moved (so big lip movements force big mouth interior movements, etc.). As a user training the model, you should ensure this mechanism remains active and well-trained. It’s largely built-in, but if you were to, say, fine-tune only one part of the model (face vs. mouth), be cautious: you wouldn’t want the lips’ network to change without updating the mouth’s network. A good strategy is to always train the whole model together (the provided scripts do joint training of both branches in the fused version). If you notice any slight misalignment (maybe the teeth appearing when mouth is supposedly closed), that’s a sign the coordination could be improved – possibly by a few more iterations of joint training. Essentially, trust the architecture’s design and train both parts concurrently so that the “lip-sync” between the lips and internal mouth is locked. This will yield very realistic results where teeth visibility, tongue movement, etc., all correspond correctly to the spoken phonemes.
	•	Adjust Training Duration and Learning Rates: With very short training videos, the fine-tuning can sometimes overfit (manifesting as jitter or the avatar only looking good on the exact training frames but not generalizing even to the test frames). To combat this, prefer a slightly shorter training duration or use techniques like early stopping – monitor a validation loss (if available) and stop when it starts to increase. Conversely, if the avatar’s mouth movements are not expressive enough or some pronunciations look off, you might need a few more training epochs to capture those details. Because we’re in a low-data regime, small tweaks can have noticeable effects. A practical tip is to generate a quick sample after certain intervals (the script could be modified to save an intermediate model checkpoint) and visually inspect it. This iterative approach can help find the sweet spot where the model has learned the person’s characteristics without over-shooting.
	•	Maintain Consistency with Pre-training: When fine-tuning, use the same settings (resolution, frame rate, feature type) as in pre-training. Any inconsistency can degrade performance. For example, if the pre-trained model learned at 512px resolution and 25 FPS, ensure your new video is also 25 FPS and resized to ~512px with the face roughly filling the frame. If the audio feature in pre-training was DeepSpeech but you switched to Wav2Vec for fine-tuning without re-training the base, it might not work optimally – the model’s audio decoder part was trained for a certain feature space. If you do want to change audio features, it’s better to also do a round of pre-training (or at least fine-tune the base on some generic data) with the new feature type.
	•	Assess “Responsiveness”: In the context of model training, this means how quickly and accurately the avatar reacts to changes in the input audio. A highly responsive avatar will start opening the mouth exactly when a sound begins and form the correct shape for each phoneme rapidly. One way to improve this during training is to ensure temporal alignment is learned well. InsTaG implicitly does this by training on consecutive video frames with matching audio. If you suspect any latency (for instance, the avatar’s mouth opens a few frames late for a plosive sound), you might check if there’s any misalignment in your training data (make sure the audio and frames weren’t off by a few frames after processing). Also, training with an audio onset loss can help – e.g., penalizing the model if it doesn’t open the mouth at the exact frame speech starts. Although not explicitly in InsTaG, you could implement a simple version by looking at when audio energy goes above a threshold and ensuring the rendered mouth is open then. Typically, though, if everything is set up correctly, InsTaG’s learned model should be very responsive thanks to the high-quality motion priors.

By following these strategies, you’ll fine-tune your InsTaG avatar model to achieve lifelike facial expressions and tight lip synchronization, making the avatar not only look like the person but also behave like a natural talking version of them.

3. Speech Synchronization

Achieving accurate phoneme-to-mouth movement synchronization is a core goal of the InsTaG framework. The system needs to ensure that each spoken sound (phoneme) corresponds to the correct mouth shape (viseme) at the right time. InsTaG approaches this by using powerful audio feature extractors and a learned audio-to-motion mapping in the model:
	•	Audio Feature Extraction: Instead of using raw audio waveforms or basic MFCC features, InsTaG relies on pre-trained speech models to convert audio into a sequence of feature vectors that encode phonetic content. During preprocessing, you have a few choices for these features:
	•	DeepSpeech: This is a speech-to-text model, but you can use its internal features (or embeddings) as a representation of phonemes. InsTaG’s default setup uses DeepSpeech features; they found it reliable and used it as a benchmark for evaluation ￼. DeepSpeech features capture linguistic content and timing, which the model uses to drive mouth movements.
	•	Wav2Vec 2.0: A modern, self-supervised model that learns speech representations from audio. Wav2Vec features generally provide more nuanced phoneme information than DeepSpeech and have been noted to perform better in most cases for lip-sync ￼. If you use Wav2Vec (the code refers to this as “esperanto” features, since one of the Wav2Vec models was trained on multilingual data codenamed Esperanto), you’ll extract features via wav2vec.py and the model will read <name>_eo.npy files. These features tend to improve the correspondence between audio and mouth shape, often yielding more natural mouth motion.
	•	AVE (Audio-Visual Entangler from SyncTalk): This is a specialized audio-visual feature used in the SyncTalk project. InsTaG’s authors observed that AVE gave the best lip-synchronization quality in few-shot scenarios ￼. Essentially, AVE features are designed to correspond closely to visual speech movements (they’re trained to maximize audio-visual correlation). If lip-sync accuracy is your top priority and your scenario fits (mostly English speech, not too much noise), AVE is a great choice. The downside mentioned is a bit of instability – possibly meaning that if the model isn’t perfectly trained, using AVE might lead to slight jitter in the output or even the training converging to a weird solution. To mitigate this, ensure thorough training (and maybe slightly more frames if possible) when using AVE. Also note, to use AVE in InsTaG, you typically don’t manually extract features – the model will call the SyncTalk submodule to process the audio on the fly, so just provide the WAV file path in the inference step with --audio flag as noted in the README ￼.
	•	HuBERT: Another self-supervised speech model (somewhat like Wav2Vec, but with a different pretraining). HuBERT features are very rich and have been shown to work well for languages beyond English. InsTaG suggests that HuBERT is more robust for non-English or out-of-domain audio, making it useful if you are doing, say, a Chinese-speaking avatar ￼. The trade-off is that HuBERT features have high dimensionality (and complexity), which in ultra-few-shot cases (only a few seconds of video) can be harder for the model to fully utilize ￼. If you choose HuBERT, try to have at least ~10 seconds of training data for better results, and be mindful of potential overfitting. Use the hubert.py script to extract <name>_hu.npy features and specify --audio_extractor hubert in training/inference.
	•	Learning the Audio-Visual Alignment: Once you have audio features, InsTaG’s model (both in pre-training and adaptation) learns to map these features to mouth movements. There isn’t a hard-coded phoneme-viseme dictionary; instead, the neural network figures it out by minimizing reconstruction error of the video frames. For example, if the audio feature at time t corresponds to an “ooh” sound, the model is trained to produce an image with rounded lips at frame t. Over the pre-training on lots of video, it develops a general sense of what shapes go with what sounds. During adaptation, it refines this to the specific person’s mouth. The phoneme-to-viseme synchronization is thus an emergent property of the training process, guided by the audio features. High-quality features (as discussed above) make this easier because they cluster sounds that look similar (like “m” and “b” which are both closed lips) in a way the network can exploit.
	•	Techniques to Improve Accuracy: If you need to further improve sync beyond what the base training gives you, consider these techniques:
	•	Phoneme Alignment Checks: Ensure your training data is well-aligned. If you can, use forced alignment tools on the transcript of the speech to get exact phoneme timing, and verify that the video frames and audio are not misaligned. A tiny offset (even 0.1s) between audio and video during training can confuse the model. Tools like Gentle or Montreal Forced Aligner can give you phoneme timestamps; use them to double-check the frame where a phoneme occurs matches the video frame’s content. InsTaG’s pipeline should handle this correctly if the video is unmodified, but any editing or frame-rate issues can introduce misalignment.
	•	Explicit Lip-Sync Loss: Some advanced users implement a lip-sync discriminator network (for instance, a pre-trained SyncNet model that judges if audio and video match). During training, you could add a loss that the generated talking head must score well with this discriminator. This encourages the model to get the fine timing right. This wasn’t explicitly mentioned in InsTaG (they rely on the reconstruction loss and the inherent synchronization of the data), but it’s a known technique in literature to boost sync. If you have the resources, you could incorporate something like this in the fine-tuning stage.
	•	Frame Rate Considerations: InsTaG uses 25 FPS. If you were to use a different frame rate (maybe your video is 30 FPS), the duration of a phoneme spans more frames at 30 FPS than at 25 FPS. The model wouldn’t know this inherently. It’s best to stick to 25 FPS to match the training regime. If you must use a different frame rate, you might need to adjust the --fps in the code (if supported) or at least ensure the audio feature sampling rate matches (e.g., DeepSpeech features are time-indexed, so as long as the timing is consistent it’s okay). The key is consistency – the model can’t handle variable time scales without retraining.
	•	Realism in Mouth Movements: Beyond raw sync, we want the mouth shapes to look natural. Realism can be improved by:
	•	Using geometry priors (as we did) to ensure the 3D structure of the mouth is learned. This prevents situations like the lips going into impossible positions. The geometry prior essentially teaches the model the shape of the teeth, jaw, etc., so when the audio says “ah” and the mouth opens, it opens in a anatomically plausible way.
	•	Multi-modal consistency: Pay attention to whether the expressions match the audio emotion. For instance, yelling “hey!” vs softly saying “hey” might both have an open mouth, but the facial tension differs. While InsTaG doesn’t explicitly model emotion in the voice, as a user you can influence this by training on data that has the appropriate expressions for the tone. In practice, if your short video has neutral emotion, the avatar will always look neutral regardless of what the audio’s emotional tone is. To get realism, you might need to later introduce some emotion control (touched on in the next section about adaptability).
	•	Evaluating with objective metrics: Use something like the SyncNet confidence score or any lip-sync error metric (InsTaG’s paper uses a lip-sync accuracy metric where lower is better). For example, a common metric is the average distance between audio MFCC features and video-based MFCC (from the mouth region) – but more sophisticated is using a pre-trained model that predicts speech from video and seeing if it matches the actual audio (the inverse of lip-reading). If your avatar gets a high score on such a metric, it means the lip movements are spot-on. You can use this as a feedback to improve the model: generate a test, measure sync, if it’s below a threshold, fine-tune a bit more or try a different audio feature.

In summary, phoneme-to-viseme synchronization in InsTaG is handled by robust audio features and careful training. To improve it, choose the best feature extractor for your case (DeepSpeech for baseline, Wav2Vec for improved sync, AVE for best sync on English ￼, or HuBERT for multilingual ￼), ensure alignment is correct, and consider additional loss or evaluation measures to fine-tune the timing. With these in place, InsTaG can produce highly accurate and realistic lip-sync, often approaching the quality of the ground truth video (as evidenced by the high lip-sync scores reported, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods) ￼ ￼.

4. Conversational Adaptability

Making your avatar not just speak accurately, but also behave in a conversationally aware manner, is an exciting next step. By default, a model like InsTaG will lip-sync to whatever audio you give it and mimic the expressions from its training video. However, real human conversation involves dynamic reactions – smiling, frowning, eye movements, head nods, etc., in response to context and emotion. Here we discuss best practices to imbue your InsTaG avatar with more conversational adaptability:
	•	Use Conversational Cues for Expression: To have the avatar respond to the conversation, you need to provide it information beyond just the raw audio. One way is to analyze the text or voice content of the conversation in real-time. For example, if you have a dialogue system feeding lines to the avatar, you can also feed an emotion classifier or sentiment analysis on those lines. If a user says something sad or the assistant (avatar) is delivering empathetic news, you’d want the avatar to look concerned or soften its expression. Implement a mapping from detected conversational context to facial expression cues. For instance: happy context -> smile (increase AU12 Lip Corner Puller), sad context -> slight frown (increase AU1/4 Brow Lowerer, AU15 Lip Corner Depressor), surprise or questions -> raise eyebrows (increase AU2/5). You can program these rules or use a model to predict an emotion label for each sentence. Then, instruct the avatar system to blend that expression in. Since InsTaG itself doesn’t take an explicit emotion input, you might achieve this by modifying the audio or features in a subtle way or by post-processing the rendered frames (e.g., using an expression transfer method). A simpler hack is to have a small library of modifier audio clips (like a gentle laugh or a sigh) that you mix into the audio when appropriate, which can induce the avatar to show a related expression. While not a perfect solution, it can trigger the model to, say, open a smile if there’s a laughter sound.
	•	Introduce an Emotion/Style Parameter: Ideally, one could extend InsTaG to accept a secondary input that represents the intended emotional tone or speaking style. Some research works do exactly this by training the model with an additional conditioning vector (for example, one-hot encode emotions). If you have data of the person speaking in different emotions, you can fine-tune separate models or a combined model with an emotion embedding. Then at runtime, set the embedding according to the conversation state. In fact, recent frameworks like ConsistentAvatar include an “emotion prompt embedding” as part of the generation process ￼, which shows that conditioning the avatar on an emotion or style prompt is feasible and effective. With InsTaG, implementing this would require modifying the network to take an extra input (which could be as simple as concatenating an emotion code to the audio features or adding a FiLM layer that is controlled by emotion). This is an advanced modification; if you’re not retraining the model at that level, an alternative is to train multiple versions of the avatar: e.g., one normal, one smiling, one sad (by selecting appropriate training clips for each, if available). Then switch the model depending on context. This model-per-emotion approach is heavy but straightforward if you have the data (e.g., one 5s happy clip, one 5s sad clip of the person).
	•	Dynamic Adjustment of Emotional State: In a conversation, emotions aren’t binary; they evolve. You might implement a simple state machine or continuous variable that tracks the avatar’s current emotional state. For example, start at neutral. If the conversation has a positive turn (user compliments or system gives good news), nudge the state toward happy. If things become negative, drift toward sad. The avatar’s expression can then be a weighted blend according to this state. Practically, you could prepare a set of key facial parameters for a few anchor states (neutral, happy, concerned) and interpolate between them based on the state. To apply this to InsTaG’s output, one idea is to intervene at the rendering stage: InsTaG uses a neural radiance field (via Gaussian splatting) to render the face. If you have control over some high-level parameters (like the latent code or features that generate expression), you could tweak those. This might mean modifying the latent features corresponding to facial muscle movements. Another, perhaps simpler, approach is a post-processing filter: run a computer vision model on the rendered frames to detect the avatar’s current expression, and if it doesn’t match the target state, slightly warp the face (there are 2D face editing techniques that can make a neutral face smile by moving keypoints). This is not trivial, but could be done with something like OpenCV (moving lip corners upward for a smile, etc.). The ideal scenario is to incorporate this into the generative process, but doing it afterward can be a practical shortcut.
	•	Explicit Expression Control Mechanisms: Some newer 3D talking head methods allow explicit control of expressions and even head movements. For example, the THGS framework (3D Talking Human via Gaussian Splatting) allows explicit control over expression and head pose in the generated avatar ￼. While InsTaG doesn’t natively expose knobs for expressions, you do have control over head pose to some extent (the model will generally follow whatever head movement was in the training video’s audio/frames alignment; you can trick it by providing a different pose sequence at inference using the --use_train or not, or even feeding it a driving video’s pose). To utilize this, if you want the avatar to nod or shake head, one hack is: take a video of the person nodding (just nodding, no speech), use that as a “pose driver,” and combine it with the speech audio of the conversation. InsTaG doesn’t have a direct driver swap mechanism built-in like some pose transfer models, but since it’s 3D, you could potentially input a custom camera or pose path. This might require code modifications. Alternatively, you could manually animate the head by rotating the rendered 3D output if you have access to the 3D parameters (the Gaussian splatting representation could, in theory, be rotated). These are advanced techniques; a simpler method is to include some natural head movement in the training video (don’t have the person perfectly still—if they naturally nod or tilt a bit while talking, the model will learn to do small motions which look more engaging).
	•	Non-verbal Sounds and Pauses: In conversation, not everything is words. There are pauses, breathing, “umm”, laughs, etc. Make sure your system handles these gracefully. If there’s a pause in speech, the avatar should close its mouth and perhaps return to a neutral or listening expression (you don’t want it to freeze awkwardly). You can achieve this by detecting silence in the audio and inserting a neutral or slight smile expression command during that time. If the user laughs or the system is supposed to laugh, consider playing a short laughter audio which will naturally make the avatar open its mouth as if laughing, and you might augment it by making the eyes squint (which could be an image post-process unless you’ve trained it in). Essentially, treat these non-verbal cues as part of the content that needs to be animated.
	•	Continuous Eye Contact and Blinking: While InsTaG’s focus is on the mouth and face, don’t forget eyes. Conversation feels natural when the avatar blinks normally and seems to look at the viewer or move its gaze purposefully. InsTaG doesn’t explicitly model eyeballs or blinking in the paper (and blinking might not be prominent in a short training clip). As a result, your avatar might not blink at all (which is unnatural). You can address this by manually editing the rendered video to add blinks at intervals (every 5-10 seconds, insert a few frames where the eyes are closed). There are deepfake and face animation tools that can do this kind of subtle edit, or you can include a blinking sample in training if possible. Similarly, if the avatar should occasionally look to the side (maybe thinking), you’d need either to train that in or edit it. For now, a practical approach is to ensure the avatar’s gaze is straightforward and steady (since adjusting it realistically is hard without explicit modeling). But blinking is relatively easy to script and goes a long way to adding life to the avatar.

In essence, conversational adaptability comes from layering additional behavior on top of the core InsTaG animations. You maintain the excellent lip-sync and base expressions from the model, and then modulate or augment them according to the context. Whether through direct conditioning (preferred, if you have means to retrain the model with an emotion parameter) or through post-generation adjustments, the goal is to reflect the conversation’s flow in the avatar’s face. With careful design, your avatar can smile when saying something joyful, look sympathetic when the user is sad, and overall respond in a human-like way, greatly enhancing the user’s experience.

5. Reinforcement Learning & Continuous Improvement

Building a truly robust talking avatar is an iterative process. Once you have an InsTaG model up and running, you’ll want to continuously improve it as it interacts with users. One powerful approach for ongoing improvement is using reinforcement learning (RL) or other feedback-driven techniques to adjust the model based on performance. Here are some strategies:
	•	Feedback Loop with Reinforcement Learning: Define what constitutes “good” performance for your avatar. This could be a combination of factors: lip-sync accuracy, low latency in responses, appropriate expressions, and user engagement. Using these factors, craft a reward function. For instance, +1 reward for each dialog turn where the avatar’s lip-sync was rated as perfect and the user’s emotional sentiment stayed positive, but -1 if the lip-sync was off or the user seemed dissatisfied. This is admittedly abstract, but you can gather proxies for these (perhaps using a secondary model to rate lip-sync, and tracking user feedback or repetition in conversation to gauge satisfaction). With a reward signal, you can use RL algorithms to tweak the avatar’s behavior. One practical implementation is to have a policy that controls some aspect of the avatar (imagine a policy that decides how exaggerated the mouth movements should be, or whether to add a smile at the end of a sentence) and then simulate conversations to see which policy yields higher rewards. Over many simulations or real interactions, the policy gets updated (e.g., using a policy gradient method) to maximize cumulative reward. In summary, RL can sit on top of your InsTaG model as an “agent” that decides subtle controls (like expression intensity) to continuously improve how the avatar interacts. This is an advanced technique and requires careful design of state (what the agent observes – could include the current conversation context, the user’s last reaction, etc.) and actions (what the agent can change – e.g., a slight adjustment to mouth movement scale or an added head nod). Start simple: maybe an action that decides if the avatar should smile or not in the next sentence, and reward it if the user responds positively. Over time, the avatar will learn when a smile is appropriate, even without explicit rules.
	•	User Feedback Integration (Supervised Fine-Tuning): Not all feedback needs to be used via RL. You can also gather data and fine-tune the model in a supervised manner. For example, after deploying the avatar, you might collect a set of instances where the avatar made a mistake or the user was unhappy. Analyze those instances: perhaps in many of them, the avatar’s lip-sync failed on fast-speaking sections, or the avatar kept a neutral face while the user laughed. You can then create additional training examples that correct these issues. In the lip-sync case, you might record the avatar’s output and the correct output (maybe the ground truth video or an improved version) and train the model to reduce the error on those cases (like knowledge distillation from a better model or ground truth). In the expression case, you might augment your training data with more expressive examples or even manually label some frames with desired expressions and fine-tune the model to follow those. This fine-tuning on feedback data is a form of continuous learning. Essentially, each time users identify a flaw, you add a correction in the training set and retrain. Make sure to do this gradually and test after each update to avoid inadvertently degrading other aspects.
	•	Automated Logging & Metrics: Implement a thorough logging system during every avatar interaction. The logs should capture:
	•	Audio input (perhaps in feature form or at least timestamps).
	•	The avatar’s generated video or key facial parameters per frame.
	•	Any available ground truth or reference (if this is a test scenario).
	•	Derived metrics like lip-sync score, blink count, smile intensity, etc.
	•	User reactions or ratings if available.
Over time, this log becomes a goldmine for analysis. You can identify patterns: e.g., “Our lip-sync score drops when there is a lot of background noise” – this might tell you to improve noise filtering or switch audio models. Or “Users rate the avatar lower late at night” – maybe the avatar’s lighting (if any) is too bright in dark environments, or perhaps irrelevant, but it’s worth investigating. Logging emotional context as well (like conversation sentiment at each turn) and the avatar’s chosen expression can let you calculate if your expression mapping is working (how often did it smile when it should have). By periodically reviewing these logs (or better, creating automated dashboards), you can spot where to apply improvements. Many issues that arise in deployment might not have been obvious in the lab, so this data-driven approach ensures you focus on real-world problems.
	•	Periodic Retraining and Model Updates: As you gather more data (both from user interactions and perhaps from deliberately recording more footage of the person or others), plan to retrain or fine-tune the InsTaG model. InsTaG’s training process is not extremely slow (especially adaptation, which is quick), so you could imagine retraining the avatar model on a larger dataset that accumulates over time. For example, after a month of usage, you have 2 minutes of the person’s speech collected (via the interactions). You could add that to the original 10s clip and re-run the adaptation (or even combine it with the pre-training step data to fine-tune the universal model slightly toward the user’s speaking style). This will continuously improve the personalization – the avatar will edge closer to perfect mimicry of the person. This concept is akin to online learning: each new data point (with the person’s real video or high-quality audio) can be used to refine the model. Just be cautious to retain a validation set to ensure you’re not overfitting as you add more data. It might be wise to keep a copy of the initial model and compare it to the updated one on a standard test set to ensure metrics are improving.
	•	Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Strategies: If your avatar is part of a conversational AI system (like a chatbot with a face), not only the visual part but the dialogue itself can be optimized with RL. For instance, OpenAI’s ChatGPT was refined with RL from human feedback for better responses. You can similarly tune the avatar’s conversational strategy – maybe it learns to phrase things in a more friendly manner because that gets better user reactions. While this is more about the AI brain than the avatar visuals, it affects the user’s perception of the avatar’s responsiveness and emotional intelligence. For a holistic improvement, consider the interplay between what the avatar says and how it looks. An RL agent controlling both speech content (through a dialogue model) and facial expression (through the avatar model) could theoretically learn an optimal policy for user satisfaction. This is complex, but research is heading in that direction.
	•	Safety and Quality Assurance: When applying reinforcement learning or continuous updates, always include checks so the avatar doesn’t drift into unwanted behavior. For example, if optimizing solely for user engagement, the system might learn that making extreme expressions draws attention – but that could be off-putting or cartoonish. So, include penalties in the reward for deviating too far from natural behavior. Keep some hard constraints (e.g., mouth movements must remain within human anatomical limits – the geometry prior helps, but RL could try to hack around things if not careful). Regularly have human evaluators review the avatar’s performance after each major update. This human-in-the-loop oversight is crucial, especially in any RL training phase, to catch errors that automated metrics won’t.

By continually applying these improvement loops, your InsTaG-based avatar will not stagnate. It will get better with time and use. Start simple – maybe log data and do a manual fine-tuning after a week – and gradually move to more sophisticated automated improvements. Users will appreciate an avatar that becomes more accurate and attuned to them over time, which can increase engagement and trust.

6. Resources & Community Support

Working with cutting-edge frameworks like InsTaG can be challenging, but fortunately there are resources and a growing community to help you:
	•	Official Documentation and Code: The first place to look is the InsTaG GitHub repository. The README file in the repo contains most of the instructions we’ve discussed (installation, data prep, training commands) and is kept up to date by the authors ￼. It also provides links to download models and the project page. If something isn’t working, double-check the README to ensure you didn’t miss a step or detail. Sometimes the authors update the repository with bug fixes or additional info, so keep an eye on it. The repository also has an Issues section – search there to see if someone has encountered your problem. For example, installation issues or runtime errors might be reported with solutions from the developers. You can open a new issue with detailed information if you need help; the authors or others in the community might respond.
	•	Research Paper and Supplementary: The InsTaG paper (CVPR 2025) is an excellent resource for understanding why the framework is designed this way ￼. Reading the paper can give insights into things like the rationale for the identity-free pre-training, details of the architecture (e.g., what the “FM hook” exactly does), and how they quantitatively measured success (which can guide your own evaluations). Sometimes, papers have supplementary material with additional implementation details or results – check the project page or arXiv for any supplementary PDF. This can contain pseudo-code or parameter settings that are useful. By understanding the paper, you’ll be better equipped to debug issues that arise (since you know what the model is supposed to be doing at each stage).
	•	Community Forums and Discussion Groups: While InsTaG itself is new, it builds on a rich history of talking head models. You may not find a dedicated InsTaG forum yet, but you can discuss it in related communities:
	•	Reddit (r/DeepLearning, r/ComputerVision): Often, users share new projects like InsTaG and discuss them. A search on Reddit might reveal a post where someone introduced InsTaG and others commented on it. You could ask questions there.
	•	Machine Learning Discords/Slack: Communities like the Hugging Face Discord, or unofficial CV/DL Discord servers, might have channels for vision or even specifically for NeRF/avatars. Engaging there could connect you with someone who has tried InsTaG or similar projects.
	•	Conference Workshops: Since InsTaG was a CVPR paper, check if the authors presented it in a workshop or gave a talk. Sometimes they share contact info during presentations. The authors (Jiahe Li et al.) might be reachable via their university emails or Twitter – many researchers are happy to answer a question or two about reproducing their work, especially if you encountered a bug in the code.
	•	Related Project Repositories: InsTaG’s README acknowledges several projects from which it borrows ideas or code ￼. These include RAD-NeRF, DFRF, GeneFace, AD-NeRF, and others. Visiting those repositories can be enlightening. For instance, GeneFace (2023) is also about audio-driven 3D talking faces and might have more documentation or active users since it’s been around longer. If you have a problem that isn’t answered in InsTaG’s issues, it might have been addressed in GeneFace’s issues. Similarly, AD-NeRF (Audio-Driven NeRF) was an earlier work; their paper or code comments could shed light on common challenges in training talking head models (like stability or quality issues) that could apply to InsTaG. By exploring these related works, you gain a broader understanding and possibly solutions to shared problems. The EasyPortrait and Sapiens tools integrated into InsTaG also have their own repos (EasyPortrait on SberCloud, Sapiens on FacebookResearch). If you hit a snag specifically with creating the teeth mask or running the Sapiens model, refer to those sources’ documentation. For example, Sapiens has a README about how to use their model, supported GPU architectures, etc. ￼ ￼ – very useful if the geometry prior step fails.
	•	Basel Face Model & OpenFace: Two external resources you interacted with are BFM and OpenFace. The BFM (Basel Face Model) website has documentation on the 3D model and a forum where people discuss issues with downloading or using the model. OpenFace has an active GitHub where you can report issues if the FeatureExtraction tool isn’t working as expected. It’s worth noting that OpenFace outputs a lot of metrics; if you want to use additional ones (like gaze direction or head pose), those are available in the CSV too, and OpenFace’s docs explain them. This could tie into making your avatar more interactive (e.g., knowing where the person was looking in training can help simulate eye contact).
	•	Community Showcases: Look out for blog posts or tutorial videos. Sometimes, after a paper like InsTaG is released, enthusiasts or graduate students will write a Medium article or make a YouTube video demonstrating it. For example, a YouTube search for “InsTaG talking head demo” might show the official demo video (the project page linked a YouTube video) and possibly others experimenting with it. Seeing how others use it can spark ideas and troubleshoot problems (“oh, they had to convert the video format to MP4 with X codec to get process.py to work – I can do that too”). The project page’s demo video itself is useful to set your expectations and as a reference for success.
	•	Future Updates: Keep in mind that InsTaG is at the forefront (CVPR 2025). It’s possible the authors or others will continue improving it. Watch the GitHub repo for any new commits or releases. Maybe an InsTaG 2.0 or an extension could appear. Also, an “awesome list” for talking head generation might include InsTaG; indeed, there is an Awesome Gaussians or Awesome Human Motion list ￼ ￼ that might list InsTaG and related works, along with links. Such lists are great for finding community-contributed tips or forks of the project.

In summary, you are not alone in this journey. Leverage the official docs and code, engage with the broader research community, and don’t hesitate to seek help on forums. As you gain experience, consider contributing back – for example, if you resolve a tricky issue, share the solution in the GitHub issues or write a short post about it. This way, the InsTaG user community will grow, and collectively you’ll make it easier to create amazing talking avatars. Good luck, and happy animating!
